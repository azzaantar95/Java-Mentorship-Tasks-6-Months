**Main flow**

1. The employee logs in to the intranet portal and selects the link to the Vacation Tracking System (VTS).
2. VTS retrieves the employee’s vacation history and balances (past 6 months and up to 18 months in the future).
3. The employee chooses a vacation category with a positive balance (e.g., annual leave).
4. The system displays a calendar to help the employee choose vacation dates.
5. The employee selects dates and hours, adds a title and short description, then submits the request.
6. The system validates the data: if errors exist, they are highlighted for correction.
7. The employee can correct errors or cancel the request.
8. If validation passes, the request is saved. If manager approval is required, an email is sent to the manager.
9. The request status becomes “Pending Approval.”
10. The manager receives an email and clicks the link to open the pending request in the VTS.
11. The manager authenticates if needed.
12. The manager views both personal requests and those awaiting approval.
13. The manager selects a pending request, reviews details, and chooses to Approve or Reject.
14. If rejected, the manager must enter a reason.
15. An email notification is sent to the employee with the result.
16. The manager can return to the main page, approve other requests, or exit the system.
